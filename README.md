# hello-world
For an informatics class, to practice the "GitHub Flow."


I'm Nathan Parker, or AKA KingPr0o7 on the WWW. I love coding, creating, and tweaking with anything that invloves with the web or small games that I find myself creating. My ultimate goal in life is to create software for developers and the public to improve their lives for the better. From the small Python libary, to complex solvers and plugins that anyone can use. Sometimes I also play games in my off time, when coding gets too much or I'm burntout. I started coding in 2018 via a local libary's Scratch club, and ever since I've been improving my fundemental programming skills to create bigger and bigger things for all.
